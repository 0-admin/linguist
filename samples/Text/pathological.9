This file contains 3 tests to help govern the accuracy of Roff VS Text heuristics.

.1 This line shouldn't be caught:

	.TH MANPAGE 5

... because Roff commands must start in the first column of the page.


.2 This line appears to be Roff,

.bedoogle

but is ignored because no man/mdoc macro exists with the name "bedoogle".


.3 This is a list of Roman numerals:

.I One
.II Two
.III Three
.IX Four
.X Five
